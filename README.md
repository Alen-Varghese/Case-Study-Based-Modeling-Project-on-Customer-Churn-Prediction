## 🎯 Objective
To develop, validate, and deploy a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn using real-world telecom data.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This repository contains all resources related to the Customer Churn Prediction Case Study.  
It follows the SRM University assignment rubric covering:
1. Data Preparation & EDA  
2. CHAID-like Model (Decision Tree using entropy)  
3. Logistic Regression Model  
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Lift, Gains)  
5. Model Deployment (Pickle)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| Accuracy | Overall model correctness |
| ROC-AUC | Model's discriminative power |
| Precision/Recall | Churn identification performance |
| Lift/Gains | Marketing & retention performance indicator |

---

## 🚀 Deployment
Models are serialized with **Pickle** and can be integrated into applications or dashboards.  
Future model updates can be automated with a retraining pipeline using new customer data.
